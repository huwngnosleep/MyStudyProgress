suppose the growth rate of an algorithm is a function 
y = 6n^2 + 100n + 300
the 6n^2 is much more larger than the remaining terms, 100n + 300

...image 1

reduce the coefficient of n^2 by 10 and increase the other two by 10
so we have function 0.6n^2 + 1000n + 3000

... image 2

as you've seen, the two charts don't change much

so that we can drop the less significant terms
Just focus on the important part
