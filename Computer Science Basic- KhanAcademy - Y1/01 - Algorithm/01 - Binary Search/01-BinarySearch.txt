find a random number from 1 to 15
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
the computer will tell each time if your guess is high or low
the best way is to start at 8
so the number is left or right 8
and reduce the numbers by half
keep going and eliminating half of the array each time
so that's Binary Search

if the array length's 8, we need at most 4 guess
length 16 then 5 guess
length n so we need log2(n) + 1 guess to find the target value
